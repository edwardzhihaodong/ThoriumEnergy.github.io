    Nuclear power
  </b>
  <br />
  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  <br />

  The 1200 MWe Leibstadt Nuclear Power Plant in Switzerland. The boiling water
  reactor (BWR), located inside the dome capped cylindrical structure, is
  dwarfed in size by its cooling tower. The station produces a yearly average of
  25 million kilowatt-hours per day, sufficient to power a city the size of
  Boston.[1] Nuclear power is the use of nuclear reactions to produce
  electricity. Nuclear power can be obtained from nuclear fission, nuclear decay
  and nuclear fusion reactions. Presently, the vast majority of electricity from
  nuclear power is produced by nuclear fission of uranium and plutonium in
  nuclear power plants. Nuclear decay processes are used in niche applications
  such as radioisotope thermoelectric generators in some space probes such as
  Voyager 2. Generating electricity from fusion power remains the focus of
  international research. Civilian nuclear power supplied 2,586 terawatt hours
  (TWh) of electricity in 2019, equivalent to about 10% of global electricity
  generation, and was the second-largest low-carbon power source after
  hydroelectricity. As of January 2021, there are 442 civilian fission reactors
  in the world, with a combined electrical capacity of 392 gigawatt (GW). There
  are also 53 nuclear power reactors under construction and 98 reactors planned,
  with a combined capacity of 60 GW and 103 GW, respectively. The United States
  has the largest fleet of nuclear reactors, generating over 800 TWh
  zero-emissions electricity per year with an average capacity factor of 92%.
  Most reactors under construction are generation III reactors in Asia. Nuclear
  power has one of the lowest levels of fatalities per unit of energy generated
  compared to other energy sources. Coal, petroleum, natural gas and
  hydroelectricity each have caused more fatalities per unit of energy due to
  air pollution and accidents. Since its commercialization in the 1970s, nuclear
  power has prevented about 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and the
  emission of about 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that would
  have otherwise resulted from the burning of fossil fuels. Accidents in nuclear
  power plants include the Chernobyl disaster in the Soviet Union in 1986, the
  Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, and the more contained
  Three Mile Island accident in the United States in 1979. There is a debate
  about nuclear power. Proponents, such as the World Nuclear Association and
  Environmentalists for Nuclear Energy, contend that nuclear power is a safe,
  sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions. Nuclear power
  opponents, such as Greenpeace and NIRS, contend that nuclear power poses many
  threats to people and the environment.

  <b>Origins</b> <br />

  The first light bulbs ever lit by electricity generated by nuclear power at
  EBR-1 at Argonne National Laboratory-West, December 20, 1951.[2] The discovery
  of nuclear fission occurred in 1938 following over four decades of work on the
  science of radioactivity and the elaboration of new nuclear physics that
  described the components of atoms. Soon after the discovery of the fission
  process, it was realized that a fissioning nucleus can induce further nucleus
  fissions, thus inducing a self-sustaining chain reaction.[3] Once this was
  experimentally confirmed in 1939, scientists in many countries petitioned
  their governments for support of nuclear fission research, just on the cusp of
  World War II, for the development of a nuclear weapon.[4] In the United
  States, these research efforts led to the creation of the first man-made
  nuclear reactor, the Chicago Pile-1, which achieved criticality on December 2,
  1942. The reactor's development was part of the Manhattan Project, the Allied
  effort to create atomic bombs during World War II. It led to the building of
  larger single-purpose production reactors for the production of weapons-grade
  plutonium for use in the first nuclear weapons. The United States tested the
  first nuclear weapon in July 1945, the Trinity test, with the atomic bombings
  of Hiroshima and Nagasaki taking place one month later. The launching ceremony
  of the USS Nautilus January 1954. In 1958 it would become the first vessel to
  reach the North Pole.[5] The Calder Hall nuclear power station in the United
  Kingdom, the world's first commercial nuclear power station. Despite the
  military nature of the first nuclear devices, the 1940s and 1950s were
  characterized by strong optimism for the potential of nuclear power to provide
  cheap and endless energy.[6] Electricity was generated for the first time by a
  nuclear reactor on December 20, 1951, at the EBR-I experimental station near
  Arco, Idaho, which initially produced about 100 kW.[7][8] In 1953, American
  President Dwight Eisenhower gave his "Atoms for Peace" speech at the United
  Nations, emphasizing the need to develop "peaceful" uses of nuclear power
  quickly. This was followed by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 which allowed
  rapid declassification of U.S. reactor technology and encouraged development
  by the private sector.

  <br /><b>First power generation</b> <br />
  The first organization to develop practical nuclear power was the U.S. Navy,
  with the S1W reactor for the purpose of propelling submarines and aircraft
  carriers. The first nuclear-powered submarine, USS Nautilus, was put to sea in
  January 1954.[9][10] The S1W reactor was a Pressurized Water Reactor. This
  design was chosen because it was simpler, more compact, and easier to operate
  compared to alternative designs, thus more suitable to be used in submarines.
  This decision would result in the PWR being the reactor of choice also for
  power generation, thus having a lasting impact on the civilian electricity
  market in the years to come.[11] On June 27, 1954, the Obninsk Nuclear Power
  Plant in the USSR became the world's first nuclear power plant to generate
  electricity for a power grid, producing around 5 megawatts of electric
  power.[12] The world's first commercial nuclear power station, Calder Hall at
  Windscale, England was connected to the national power grid on 27 August 1956.
  In common with a number of other generation I reactors, the plant had the dual
  purpose of producing electricity and plutonium-239, the latter for the nascent
  nuclear weapons program in Britain.[13] The first major accident at a nuclear
  reactor occurred in 1961 at the SL-1, a U.S. Army experimental nuclear power
  reactor at the Idaho National Laboratory. An uncontrolled chain reaction
  resulted in a steam explosion which killed the three crew members and caused a
  meltdown.[14][15] Another serious accident happened in 1968, when one of the
  two liquid-metal-cooled reactors on board the Soviet submarine K-27 underwent
  a fuel element failure, with the emission of gaseous fission products into the
  surrounding air, resulting in 9 crew fatalities and 83 injuries.[16]

  <br /><b>Expansion and first opposition</b> <br />

  The total global installed nuclear capacity initially rose relatively quickly,
  rising from less than 1 gigawatt (GW) in 1960 to 100 GW in the late 1970s.[9]
  During the 1970s and 1980s rising economic costs (related to extended
  construction times largely due to regulatory changes and pressure-group
  litigation)[17] and falling fossil fuel prices made nuclear power plants then
  under construction less attractive. In the 1980s in the U.S. and 1990s in
  Europe, the flat electric grid growth and electricity liberalization also made
  the addition of large new baseload energy generators economically
  unattractive. The 1973 oil crisis had a significant effect on countries, such
  as France and Japan, which had relied more heavily on oil for electric
  generation to invest in nuclear power.[18] France would construct 25 nuclear
  power plants over the next 15 years,[19][20] and as of 2019, 71% of French
  electricity was generated by nuclear power, the highest percentage by any
  nation in the world.[21] Some local opposition to nuclear power emerged in the
  United States in the early 1960s.[22] In the late 1960s some members of the
  scientific community began to express pointed concerns.[23] These anti-nuclear
  concerns related to nuclear accidents, nuclear proliferation, nuclear
  terrorism and radioactive waste disposal.[24] In the early 1970s, there were
  large protests about a proposed nuclear power plant in Wyhl, Germany. The
  project was cancelled in 1975 the anti-nuclear success at Wyhl inspired
  opposition to nuclear power in other parts of Europe and North
  America.[25][26] By the mid-1970s anti-nuclear activism gained a wider appeal
  and influence, and nuclear power began to become an issue of major public
  protest.[27][28] In some countries, the nuclear power conflict "reached an
  intensity unprecedented in the history of technology controversies".[29][30]
  The increased public hostility to nuclear power led to a longer license
  procurement process, regulations and increased requirements for safety
  equipment, which made new construction much more expensive.[31][32] In the
  United States, over 120 LWR reactor proposals were ultimately cancelled[33]
  and the construction of new reactors ground to a halt.[34] The 1979 accident
  at Three Mile Island with no fatalities, played a major part in the reduction
  in the number of new plant constructions in many countries.[23]

  Chernobyl New Safe Confinement arch in the distance. Olkiluoto 3 under
  construction in 2009. It was the first EPR, a modernized PWR design, to start
  construction. During the 1980s one new nuclear reactor started up every 17
  days on average.[35] By the end of the decade, global installed nuclear
  capacity reached 300 GW. Since the late 1980s, new capacity additions slowed
  down significantly, with the installed nuclear capacity reaching 366 GW in
  2005. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster in the USSR, involving an RBMK reactor,
  altered the development of nuclear power and led to a greater focus on meeting
  international safety and regulatory standards.[36] It is considered the worst
  nuclear disaster in history both in total casualties, with 56 direct deaths,
  and financially, with the cleanup and the cost estimated at 18 billion Soviet
  rubles (US$68 billion in 2019, adjusted for inflation).[37][38] The
  international organization to promote safety awareness and the professional
  development of operators in nuclear facilities, the World Association of
  Nuclear Operators (WANO), was created as a direct outcome of the 1986
  Chernobyl accident. The Chernobyl disaster played a major part in the
  reduction in the number of new plant constructions in the following years.[23]
  Influenced by these events, Italy voted against nuclear power in a 1987
  referendum, becoming the first country to completely phase out nuclear power
  in 1990. In the early 2000s, nuclear energy was expecting a nuclear
  renaissance, an increase in the construction of new reactors, due to concerns
  about carbon dioxide emissions.[39] During this period, newer generation III
  reactors, such as the EPR began construction, although encountering problems
  and delays, and going significantly over budget.[40] Net electrical generation

  five fission-energy producing countries (US EIA data) Fukushima and current
  prospects Nuclear power generation (TWh) and operational nuclear reactors
  since 1997[41] Plans for a nuclear renaissance were ended by another nuclear
  accident.[42][39] The 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident was caused by a
  large tsunami triggered by the Tōhoku earthquake, one of the largest
  earthquakes ever recorded. The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant suffered
  three core meltdowns due to failure of the emergency cooling system for lack
  of electricity supply. This resulted in the most serious nuclear accident
  since the Chernobyl disaster. The accident prompted a re-examination of
  nuclear safety and nuclear energy policy in many countries.[43] Germany
  approved plans to close all its reactors by 2022, and many other countries
  reviewed their nuclear power programs.[44][45][46][47] Following the disaster,
  Japan shut down all of its nuclear power reactors, some of them permanently,
  and in 2015 began a gradual process to restart the remaining 40 reactors,
  following safety checks and based on revised criteria for operations and
  public approval.[48] By 2015, the IAEA's outlook for nuclear energy had become
  more promising, recognizing the importance of low-carbon generation for
  mitigating climate change.[49] As of 2015, the global trend was for new
  nuclear power stations coming online to be balanced by the number of old
  plants being retired.[50] In 2016, the U.S. Energy Information Administration
  projected for its "base case" that world nuclear power generation would
  increase from 2,344 terawatt hours (TWh) in 2012 to 4,500 TWh in 2040. Most of
  the predicted increase was expected to be in Asia.[51] As of 2018, there are
  over 150 nuclear reactors planned including 50 under construction.[52] In
  January 2019, China had 45 reactors in operation, 13 under construction, and
  plans to build 43 more, which would make it the world's largest generator of
  nuclear electricity.[53] Nuclear power plants File:PWR nuclear power plant

  See also: List of nuclear reactors and List of nuclear power stations Nuclear
  power plants are thermal power stations that generate electricity by
  harnessing the thermal energy released from nuclear fission. A fission nuclear
  power plant is generally composed of a nuclear reactor, in which the nuclear
  reactions generating heat take place; a cooling system, which removes the heat
  from inside the reactor; a steam turbine, which transforms the heat into
  mechanical energy; an electric generator, which transforms the mechanical
  energy into electrical energy.[55] When a neutron hits the nucleus of a
  uranium-235 or plutonium atom, it can split the nucleus into two smaller
  nuclei. The reaction is called nuclear fission. The fission reaction releases
  energy and neutrons. The released neutrons can hit other uranium or plutonium
  nuclei, causing new fission reactions, which release more energy and more
  neutrons. This is called a chain reaction. In most commercial reactors, the
  reaction rate is controlled by control rods that absorb excess neutrons. The
  controllability of nuclear reactors depends on the fact that a small fraction
  of neutrons resulting from fission are delayed. The time delay between the
  fission and the release of the neutrons slows down changes in reaction rates
  and gives time for moving the control rods to adjust the reaction
  rate.[55][56] Life cycle of nuclear fuel The nuclear fuel cycle begins when
  uranium is mined, enriched, and manufactured into nuclear fuel (1), which is
  delivered to a nuclear power plant. After use, the spent fuel is delivered to
  a reprocessing plant (2) or to a final repository (3). In nuclear reprocessing
  95% of spent fuel can potentially be recycled to be returned to use in a power
  plant (4). Main articles: Nuclear fuel cycle and Integrated Nuclear Fuel Cycle
  Information System The life cycle of nuclear fuel starts with uranium mining.
  The uranium ore is then converted into a compact ore concentrate form, known
  as yellowcake (U3O8), to facilitate transport.[57] Fission reactors generally
  need uranium-235, a fissile isotope of uranium. The concentration of
  uranium-235 in natural uranium is very low, at about 0.7%. Some reactors can
  use this natural uranium as fuel, depending on their neutron economy. These
  reactors generally have graphite or heavy water moderators. For light water
  reactors, the most common type of reactor, this concentration is too low, and
  it must be increased by a process called uranium enrichment.[57] In civilian
  light water reactors, uranium is typically enriched to 3.5-5% uranium-235.[58]
  The uranium is then generally converted into uranium oxide (UO2), a ceramic,
  that is then compressively sintered into fuel pellets, a stack of which forms
  fuel rods of the proper composition and geometry for the particular
  reactor.[58] After some time in the reactor, the fuel will have reduced
  fissile material and increased fission products, until its use becomes
  impractical.[58] At this point, the spent fuel will be moved to a spent fuel
  pool which provides cooling for the thermal heat and shielding for ionizing
  radiation. After several months or years, the spent fuel is radioactively and
  thermally cool enough to be moved to dry storage casks or reprocessed.[58]
  Uranium resources Main articles: Uranium market, Uranium mining, and Energy
  development § Nuclear Proportions of the isotopes uranium-238 (blue) and
  uranium-235 (red) found in natural uranium and in enriched uranium for
  different applications. Light water reactors use 3-5% enriched uranium, while
  CANDU reactors work with natural uranium. Uranium is a fairly common element
  in the Earth's crust: it is approximately as common as tin or germanium, and
  is about 40 times more common than silver.[59] Uranium is present in trace
  concentrations in most rocks, dirt, and ocean water, but is generally
  economically extracted only where it is present in high concentrations.
  Uranium mining can be underground, open-pit, or in-situ leach mining. An
  increasing number of the highest output mines are remote underground
  operations, such as McArthur River uranium mine, in Canada, which by itself
  accounts for 13% of global production. As of 2011 the world's known resources
  of uranium, economically recoverable at the arbitrary price ceiling of
  US$130/kg, were enough to last for between 70 and 100 years.[60][61][62] In
  2007, the OECD estimated 670 years of economically recoverable uranium in
  total conventional resources and phosphate ores assuming the then-current use
  rate.[63] Light water reactors make relatively inefficient use of nuclear
  fuel, mostly using only the very rare uranium-235 isotope.[64] Nuclear
  reprocessing can make this waste reusable, and newer reactors also achieve a
  more efficient use of the available resources than older ones.[64] With a pure
  fast reactor fuel cycle with a burn up of all the uranium and actinides (which
  presently make up the most hazardous substances in nuclear waste), there is an
  estimated 160,000 years worth of Uranium in total conventional resources and
  phosphate ore at the price of 60–100 US$/kg.[65] Unconventional uranium
  resources also exist. Uranium is naturally present in seawater at a
  concentration of about 3 micrograms per liter,[66][67][68] with 4.4 billion
  tons of uranium considered present in seawater at any time.[69] In 2014 it was
  suggested that it would be economically competitive to produce nuclear fuel
  from seawater if the process was implemented at large scale.[70] Over
  geological timescales, uranium extracted on an industrial scale from seawater
  would be replenished by both river erosion of rocks and the natural process of
  uranium dissolved from the surface area of the ocean floor, both of which
  maintain the solubility equilibria of seawater concentration at a stable
  level.[69] Some commentators have argued that this strengthens the case for
  nuclear power to be considered a renewable energy.[71] Nuclear waste Main
  article: Nuclear waste Typical composition of uranium dioxide fuel before and
  after approximately 3 years in the once-through nuclear fuel cycle of a
  LWR.[72] The normal operation of nuclear power plants and facilities produce
  radioactive waste, or nuclear waste. This type of waste is also produced
  during plant decommissioning. There are two broad categories of nuclear waste:
  low-level waste and high-level waste.[73] The first has low radioactivity and
  includes contaminated items such as clothing, which poses limited threat.
  High-level waste is mainly the spent fuel from nuclear reactors, which is very
  radioactive and must be cooled and then safely disposed of or reprocessed.[73]
  High-level waste Main articles: High-level waste and Spent nuclear fuel
  Activity of spent UOx fuel in comparison to the activity of natural uranium
  ore over time.[74][72] Dry cask storage vessels storing spent nuclear fuel
  assemblies The most important waste stream from nuclear power reactors is
  spent nuclear fuel, which is considered high-level waste. For LWRs, spent fuel
  is typically composed of 95% uranium, 4% fission products, and about 1%
  transuranic actinides (mostly plutonium, neptunium and americium).[75] The
  plutonium and other transuranics are responsible for the bulk of the long-term
  radioactivity, whereas the fission products are responsible for the bulk of
  the short-term radioactivity.[76] High-level waste requires treatment,
  management, and isolation from the environment. These operations present
  considerable challenges due to the extremely long periods these materials
  remain potentially hazardous to living organisms. This is due to long-lived
  fission products (LLFP), such as technetium-99 (half-life 220,000 years) and
  iodine-129 (half-life 15.7 million years).[77] LLFP dominate the waste stream
  in terms of radioactivity, after the more intensely radioactive short-lived
  fission products (SLFPs) have decayed into stable elements, which takes
  approximately 300 years.[72] After about 500 years, the waste becomes less
  radioactive than natural uranium ore.[78] Commonly suggested methods to
  isolate LLFP waste from the biosphere include separation and
  transmutation,[72] synroc treatments, or deep geological
  storage.[79][80][81][82] Thermal-neutron reactors, which presently constitute
  the majority of the world fleet, cannot burn up the reactor grade plutonium
  that is generated during the reactor operation. This limits the life of
  nuclear fuel to a few years. In some countries, such as the United States,
  spent fuel is classified in its entirety as a nuclear waste.[83] In other
  countries, such as France, it is largely reprocessed to produce a partially
  recycled fuel, known as mixed oxide fuel or MOX. For spent fuel that does not
  undergo reprocessing, the most concerning isotopes are the medium-lived
  transuranic elements, which are led by reactor-grade plutonium (half-life
  24,000 years).[84] Some proposed reactor designs, such as the Integral Fast
  Reactor and molten salt reactors, can use as fuel the plutonium and other
  actinides in spent fuel from light water reactors, thanks to their fast
  fission spectrum. This offers a potentially more attractive alternative to
  deep geological disposal.[85][86][87] The thorium fuel cycle results in
  similar fission products, though creates a much smaller proportion of
  transuranic elements from neutron capture events within a reactor. Spent
  thorium fuel, although more difficult to handle than spent uranium fuel, may
  present somewhat lower proliferation risks.[88] Low-level waste Main article:
  Low-level waste The nuclear industry also produces a large volume of low-level
  waste, with low radioactivity, in the form of contaminated items like
  clothing, hand tools, water purifier resins, and (upon decommissioning) the
  materials of which the reactor itself is built. Low-level waste can be stored
  on-site until radiation levels are low enough to be disposed of as ordinary
  waste, or it can be sent to a low-level waste disposal site.[89] Waste
  relative to other types See also: Radioactive waste § Naturally occurring
  radioactive material In countries with nuclear power, radioactive wastes
  account for less than 1% of total industrial toxic wastes, much of which
  remains hazardous for long periods.[64] Overall, nuclear power produces far
  less waste material by volume than fossil-fuel based power plants.[90]
  Coal-burning plants, in particular, produce large amounts of toxic and mildly
  radioactive ash resulting from the concentration of naturally occurring
  radioactive materials in coal.[91] A 2008 report from Oak Ridge National
  Laboratory concluded that coal power actually results in more radioactivity
  being released into the environment than nuclear power operation, and that the
  population effective dose equivalent from radiation from coal plants is 100
  times that from the operation of nuclear plants.[92] Although coal ash is much
  less radioactive than spent nuclear fuel by weight, coal ash is produced in
  much higher quantities per unit of energy generated. It is also released
  directly into the environment as fly ash, whereas nuclear plants use shielding
  to protect the environment from radioactive materials.[93] Nuclear waste
  volume is small compared to the energy produced. For example, at Yankee Rowe
  Nuclear Power Station, which generated 44 billion kilowatt hours of
  electricity when in service, its complete spent fuel inventory is contained
  within sixteen casks.[94] It is estimated that to produce a lifetime supply of
  energy for a person at a western standard of living (approximately 3 GWh)
  would require on the order of the volume of a soda can of low enriched
  uranium, resulting in a similar volume of spent fuel generated.[95][96][97]
  Waste disposal See also: List of radioactive waste treatment technologies
  Storage of radioactive waste at WIPP Nuclear waste flasks generated by the
  United States during the Cold War are stored underground at the Waste
  Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in New Mexico. The facility is seen as a
  potential demonstration for storing spent fuel from civilian reactors.
  Following interim storage in a spent fuel pool, the bundles of used fuel rod
  assemblies of a typical nuclear power station are often stored on site in dry
  cask storage vessels.[98] Presently, waste is mainly stored at individual
  reactor sites and there are over 430 locations around the world where
  radioactive material continues to accumulate. Disposal of nuclear waste is
  often considered the most politically divisive aspect in the lifecycle of a
  nuclear power facility.[99] With the lack of movement of nuclear waste in the
  2 billion year old natural nuclear fission reactors in Oklo, Gabon being cited
  as "a source of essential information today."[100][101] Experts suggest that
  centralized underground repositories which are well-managed, guarded, and
  monitored, would be a vast improvement.[99] There is an "international
  consensus on the advisability of storing nuclear waste in deep geological
  repositories".[102] With the advent of new technologies, other methods
  including horizontal drillhole disposal into geologically inactive areas have
  been proposed.[103][104] Most waste packaging, small-scale experimental fuel
  recycling chemistry and radiopharmaceutical refinement is conducted within
  remote-handled hot cells. There are no commercial scale purpose built
  underground high-level waste repositories in operation.[102][105][106]
  However, in Finland the Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository of the Olkiluoto
  Nuclear Power Plant is under construction as of 2015.[107] Reprocessing Main
  article: Nuclear reprocessing See also: Plutonium Management and Disposition
  Agreement Most thermal-neutron reactors run on a once-through nuclear fuel
  cycle, mainly due to the low price of fresh uranium. However, many reactors
  are also fueled with recycled fissionable materials that remain in spent
  nuclear fuel. The most common fissionable material that is recycled is the
  reactor-grade plutonium (RGPu) that is extracted from spent fuel, it is mixed
  with uranium oxide and fabricated into mixed-oxide or MOX fuel. Because
  thermal LWRs remain the most common reactor worldwide, this type of recycling
  is the most common. It is considered to increase the sustainability of the
  nuclear fuel cycle, reduce the attractiveness of spent fuel to theft, and
  lower the volume of high level nuclear waste.[108] Spent MOX fuel cannot
  generally be recycled for use in thermal-neutron reactors. This issue does not
  affect fast-neutron reactors, which are therefore preferred in order to
  achieve the full energy potential of the original uranium.[109][110] The main
  constituent of spent fuel from LWRs is slightly enriched uranium. This can be
  recycled into reprocessed uranium (RepU), which can be used in a fast reactor,
  used directly as fuel in CANDU reactors, or re-enriched for another cycle
  through an LWR. Re-enriching of reprocessed uranium is common in France and
  Russia.[111] Reprocessed uranium is also safer in terms of nuclear
  proliferation potential.[112][113][114] Reprocessing has the potential to
  recover up to 95% of the uranium and plutonium fuel in spent nuclear fuel, as
  well as reduce long-term radioactivity within the remaining waste. However,
  reprocessing has been politically controversial because of the potential for
  nuclear proliferation and varied perceptions of increasing the vulnerability
  to nuclear terrorism.[109][115] Reprocessing also leads to higher fuel cost
  compared to the once-through fuel cycle.[109][115] While reprocessing reduces
  the volume of high-level waste, it does not reduce the fission products that
  are the primary causes of residual heat generation and radioactivity for the
  first few centuries outside the reactor. Thus, reprocessed waste still
  requires an almost identical treatment for the initial first few hundred
  years. Reprocessing of civilian fuel from power reactors is currently done in
  France, the United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, and India. In the United States,
  spent nuclear fuel is currently not reprocessed.[111] The La Hague
  reprocessing facility in France has operated commercially since 1976 and is
  responsible for half the world's reprocessing as of 2010.[116] It produces MOX
  fuel from spent fuel derived from several countries. More than 32,000 tonnes
  of spent fuel had been reprocessed as of 2015, with the majority from France,
  17% from Germany, and 9% from Japan.[117] Breeding Nuclear fuel assemblies
  being inspected before entering a pressurized water reactor in the United
  States. Main articles: Breeder reactor and Nuclear power proposed as renewable
  energy Breeding is the process of converting non-fissile material into fissile
  material that can be used as nuclear fuel. The non-fissile material that can
  be used for this process is called fertile material, and constitute the vast
  majority of current nuclear waste. This breeding process occurs naturally in
  breeder reactors. As opposed to light water thermal-neutron reactors, which
  use uranium-235 (0.7% of all natural uranium), fast-neutron breeder reactors
  use uranium-238 (99.3% of all natural uranium) or thorium. A number of fuel
  cycles and breeder reactor combinations are considered to be sustainable or
  renewable sources of energy.[118][119] In 2006 it was estimated that with
  seawater extraction, there was likely five billion years' worth of uranium
  resources for use in breeder reactors.[120] Breeder technology has been used
  in several reactors, but as of 2006, the high cost of reprocessing fuel safely
  requires uranium prices of more than US$200/kg before becoming justified
  economically.[121] Breeder reactors are however being developed for their
  potential to burn up all of the actinides (the most active and dangerous
  components) in the present inventory of nuclear waste, while also producing
  power and creating additional quantities of fuel for more reactors via the
  breeding process.[122][123] As of 2017, there are two breeders producing
  commercial power, BN-600 reactor and the BN-800 reactor, both in Russia.[124]
  The Phénix breeder reactor in France was powered down in 2009 after 36 years
  of operation.[124] Both China and India are building breeder reactors. The
  Indian 500 MWe Prototype Fast Breeder Reactor is in the commissioning
  phase,[125] with plans to build more.[126] Another alternative to fast-neutron
  breeders are thermal-neutron breeder reactors that use uranium-233 bred from
  thorium as fission fuel in the thorium fuel cycle.[127] Thorium is about 3.5
  times more common than uranium in the Earth's crust, and has different
  geographic characteristics.[127] India's three-stage nuclear power programme
  features the use of a thorium fuel cycle in the third stage, as it has
  abundant thorium reserves but little uranium.[127] Nuclear decommissioning
  Main article: Nuclear decommissioning Nuclear decommissioning is the process
  of dismantling a nuclear facility to the point that it no longer requires
  measures for radiation protection,[128] returning the facility and its parts
  to a safe enough level to be entrusted for other uses.[129] Due to the
  presence of radioactive materials, nuclear decommissioning presents technical
  and economic challenges.[130] The costs of decommissioning are generally
  spread over the lifetime of a facility and saved in a decommissioning
  fund.[131] Installed capacity and electricity production Further information:
  Nuclear power by country and List of nuclear reactors The status of nuclear
  power globally (click for legend) Share of electricity production from
  nuclear, 2015[132] World electricity generation by source in 2018. Total
  generation was 26.7 PWh.[133] Coal (38%) Natural gas (23%) Hydro (16%) Nuclear
  (10%) Wind (5%) Oil (3%) Solar (2%) Biofuels (2%) Other (1%) Civilian nuclear
  power supplied 2,586 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity in 2019, equivalent
  to about 10% of global electricity generation, and was the second largest
  low-carbon power source after hydroelectricity.[41][134] Since electricity
  accounts for about 25% of world energy consumption, nuclear power's
  contribution to global energy was about 2.5% in 2011.[135] This is a little
  more than the combined global electricity production from wind, solar, biomass
  and geothermal power, which together provided 2% of global final energy
  consumption in 2014.[136] Nuclear power's share of global electricity
  production has fallen from 16.5% in 1997, in large part because the economics
  of nuclear power have become more difficult.[137] As of January 2021, there
  are 442 civilian fission reactors in the world, with a combined electrical
  capacity of 392 gigawatt (GW). There are also 53 nuclear power reactors under
  construction and 98 reactors planned, with a combined capacity of 60 GW and
  103 GW, respectively.[138] The United States has the largest fleet of nuclear
  reactors, generating over 800 TWh per year with an average capacity factor of
  92%.[139] Most reactors under construction are generation III reactors in
  Asia.[140] Regional differences in the use of nuclear power are large. The
  United States produces the most nuclear energy in the world, with nuclear
  power providing 20% of the electricity it consumes, while France produces the
  highest percentage of its electrical energy from nuclear reactors – 71% in
  2019.[21] In the European Union, nuclear power provides 26% of the electricity
  as of 2018.[141] Nuclear power is the single largest low-carbon electricity
  source in the United States,[142] and accounts for two-thirds of the European
  Union's low-carbon electricity.[143] Nuclear energy policy differs among
  European Union countries, and some, such as Austria, Estonia, Ireland and
  Italy, have no active nuclear power stations. In addition, there were
  approximately 140 naval vessels using nuclear propulsion in operation, powered
  by about 180 reactors.[144][145] These include military and some civilian
  ships, such as nuclear-powered icebreakers.[146] International research is
  continuing into additional uses of process heat such as hydrogen production
  (in support of a hydrogen economy), for desalinating sea water, and for use in
  district heating systems.[147] Economics Main articles: Economics of nuclear
  power plants, List of companies in the nuclear sector, and cost of electricity
  by source The Ikata Nuclear Power Plant, a pressurized water reactor that
  cools by utilizing a secondary coolant heat exchanger with a large body of
  water, an alternative cooling approach to large cooling towers. The economics
  of new nuclear power plants is a controversial subject, since there are
  diverging views on this topic, and multibillion-dollar investments depend on
  the choice of an energy source. Nuclear power plants typically have high
  capital costs for building the plant, but low fuel costs. For this reason,
  comparison with other power generation methods is strongly dependent on
  assumptions about construction timescales and capital financing for nuclear
  plants. The high cost of construction is one of the biggest challenges for
  nuclear power plants. A new 1,100 MW plant is estimated to cost between $6
  billion to $9 billion.[148] Nuclear power cost trends show large disparity by
  nation, design, build rate and the establishment of familiarity in expertise.
  The only two nations for which data is available that saw cost decreases in
  the 2000s were India and South Korea.[149] Analysis of the economics of
  nuclear power must also take into account who bears the risks of future
  uncertainties. As of 2010, all operating nuclear power plants have been
  developed by state-owned or regulated electric utility monopolies.[150] Many
  countries have since liberalized the electricity market where these risks, and
  the risk of cheaper competitors emerging before capital costs are recovered,
  are borne by plant suppliers and operators rather than consumers, which leads
  to a significantly different evaluation of the economics of new nuclear power
  plants.[151] The levelized cost of electricity from a new nuclear power plant
  is estimated to be 69 USD/MWh, according to an analysis by the International
  Energy Agency and the OECD Nuclear Energy Agency. This represents the median
  cost estimate for an nth-of-a-kind nuclear power plant to be completed in
  2025, at a discount rate of 7%. Nuclear power was found to be the least-cost
  option among dispatchable technologies.[152] Variable renewables can generate
  cheaper electricity: the median cost of onshore wind power was estimated to be
  50 USD/MWh, and utility-scale solar power 56 USD/MWh.[152] At the assumed CO2
  emission cost of USD 30 per ton, power from coal (88 USD/MWh) and gas (71
  USD/MWh) is more expensive than low-carbon technologies. Electricity from
  long-term operation of nuclear power plants by lifetime extension was found
  the be the least-cost option, at 32 USD/MWh.[152] Measures to mitigate global
  warming, such as a carbon tax or carbon emissions trading, may favor the
  economics of nuclear power.[153][154] New small modular reactors, such as
  those developed by NuScale Power, are aimed at reducing the investment costs
  for new construction by making the reactors smaller and modular, so that they
  can be built in a factory. Certain designs had considerable early positive
  economics, such as the CANDU, which realized much higher capacity factor and
  reliability when compared to generation II light water reactors up to the
  1990s.[155] Nuclear power plants, though capable of some grid-load following,
  are typically run as much as possible to keep the cost of the generated
  electrical energy as low as possible, supplying mostly base-load
  electricity.[156] Due to the on-line refueling reactor design, PHWRs (of which
  the CANDU design is a part) continue to hold many world record positions for
  longest continual electricity generation, often over 800 days.[157] The
  specific record as of 2019 is held by a PHWR at Kaiga Atomic Power Station,
  generating electricity continuously for 962 days.[158] Use in space The
  Multi-mission radioisotope thermoelectric generator (MMRTG), used in several
  space missions such as the Curiosity Mars rover Main article: Nuclear power in
  space The most common use of nuclear power in space is the use of radioisotope
  thermoelectric generators, which use radioactive decay to generate power.
  These power generators are relatively small scale (few kW), and they are
  mostly used to power space missions and experiments for long periods where
  solar power is not available in sufficient quantity, such as in the Voyager 2
  space probe.[159] A few space vehicles have been launched using nuclear
  reactors: 34 reactors belong to the Soviet RORSAT series and one was the
  American SNAP-10A.[159] Both fission and fusion appear promising for space
  propulsion applications, generating higher mission velocities with less
  reaction mass.[159][160] Safety See also: Nuclear safety and security and
  Nuclear reactor safety system Death rates from air pollution and accidents
  related to energy production, measured in deaths per terawatt hours (TWh)
  Deaths per TWh per energy source in the European Union Nuclear power plants
  have three unique characteristics that affect their safety, as compared to
  other power plants. Firstly, intensely radioactive materials are present in a
  nuclear reactor. Their release to the environment could be hazardous.
  Secondly, the fission products, which make up most of the intensely
  radioactive substances in the reactor, continue to generate a significant
  amount of decay heat even after the fission chain reaction has stopped. If the
  heat cannot be removed from the reactor, the fuel rods may overheat and
  release radioactive materials. Thirdly, a criticality accident (a rapid
  increase of the reactor power) is possible in certain reactor designs if the
  chain reaction cannot be controlled. These three characteristics have to be
  taken into account when designing nuclear reactors.[161] All modern reactors
  are designed so that an uncontrolled increase of the reactor power is
  prevented by natural feedback mechanisms, a concept known as negative void
  coefficient of reactivity. If the temperature or the amount of steam in the
  reactor increases, the fission rate inherently decreases. The chain reaction
  can also be manually stopped by inserting control rods into the reactor core.
  Emergency core cooling systems (ECCS) can remove the decay heat from the
  reactor if normal cooling systems fail.[162] If the ECCS fails, multiple
  physical barriers limit the release of radioactive materials to the
  environment even in the case of an accident. The last physical barrier is the
  large containment building.[161] With a death rate of 0.07 per TWh, nuclear
  power is the safest energy source per unit of energy generated.[163] Energy
  produced by coal, petroleum, natural gas and hydropower has caused more deaths
  per unit of energy generated due to air pollution and energy accidents. This
  is found when comparing the immediate deaths from other energy sources to both
  the immediate and the latent, or predicted, indirect cancer deaths from
  nuclear energy accidents.[164][165] When the direct and indirect fatalities
  (including fatalities resulting from the mining and air pollution) from
  nuclear power and fossil fuels are compared,[166] the use of nuclear power has
  been calculated to have prevented about 1.8 million deaths between 1971 and
  2009, by reducing the proportion of energy that would otherwise have been
  generated by fossil fuels.[167][168] Following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear
  disaster, it has been estimated that if Japan had never adopted nuclear power,
  accidents and pollution from coal or gas plants would have caused more lost
  years of life.[169] Serious impacts of nuclear accidents are often not
  directly attributable to radiation exposure, but rather social and
  psychological effects. Evacuation and long-term displacement of affected
  populations created problems for many people, especially the elderly and
  hospital patients.[170] Forced evacuation from a nuclear accident may lead to
  social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems,
  reckless behavior, and suicide. A comprehensive 2005 study on the aftermath of
  the Chernobyl disaster concluded that the mental health impact is the largest
  public health problem caused by the accident.[171] Frank N. von Hippel, an
  American scientist, commented that a disproportionate fear of ionizing
  radiation (radiophobia) could have long-term psychological effects on the
  population of contaminated areas following the Fukushima disaster.[172] In
  January 2015, the number of Fukushima evacuees was around 119,000, compared
  with a peak of around 164,000 in June 2012.[173] Accidents and attacks
  Accidents Following the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, the world's
  worst nuclear accident since 1986, 50,000 households were displaced after
  radiation leaked into the air, soil and sea.[174] Radiation checks led to bans
  of some shipments of vegetables and fish.[175] Reactor decay heat as a
  fraction of full power after the reactor shutdown, using two different
  correlations. To remove the decay heat, reactors need cooling after the
  shutdown of the fission reactions. A loss of the ability to remove decay heat
  caused the Fukushima accident. See also: Energy accidents, Nuclear and
  radiation accidents and incidents, and Lists of nuclear disasters and
  radioactive incidents Some serious nuclear and radiation accidents have
  occurred. The severity of nuclear accidents is generally classified using the
  International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) introduced by the International
  Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). The scale ranks anomalous events or accidents on
  a scale from 0 (a deviation from normal operation that poses no safety risk)
  to 7 (a major accident with widespread effects). There have been 3 accidents
  of level 5 or higher in the civilian nuclear power industry, two of which, the
  Chernobyl accident and the Fukushima accident, are ranked at level 7. The
  Chernobyl accident in 1986 caused approximately 50 deaths from direct and
  indirect effects, and some temporary serious injuries from acute radiation
  syndrome.[176] The future predicted mortality from increases in cancer rates
  is estimated at about 4000 in the decades to come.[177][178][179] The
  Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident was caused by the 2011 Tohoku earthquake
  and tsunami. The accident has not caused any radiation-related deaths but
  resulted in radioactive contamination of surrounding areas. The difficult
  cleanup operation is expected to cost tens of billions of dollars over 40 or
  more years.[180][181] The Three Mile Island accident in 1979 was a smaller
  scale accident, rated at INES level 5. There were no direct or indirect deaths
  caused by the accident.[182] The impact of nuclear accidents is controversial.
  According to Benjamin K. Sovacool, fission energy accidents ranked first among
  energy sources in terms of their total economic cost, accounting for 41
  percent of all property damage attributed to energy accidents.[183] Another
  analysis found that coal, oil, liquid petroleum gas and hydroelectric
  accidents (primarily due to the Banqiao Dam disaster) have resulted in greater
  economic impacts than nuclear power accidents.[184] The study compares latent
  cancer deaths attributable to nuclear with immediate deaths from other energy
  sources per unit of energy generated, and does not include fossil fuel related
  cancer and other indirect deaths created by the use of fossil fuel consumption
  in its "severe accident" (an accident with more than 5 fatalities)
  classification. Nuclear power works under an insurance framework that limits
  or structures accident liabilities in accordance with national and
  international conventions.[185] It is often argued that this potential
  shortfall in liability represents an external cost not included in the cost of
  nuclear electricity. This cost is small, amounting to about 0.1% of the
  levelized cost of electricity, according to a study by the Congressional
  Budget Office in the United States.[186] These beyond-regular insurance costs
  for worst-case scenarios are not unique to nuclear power. Hydroelectric power
  plants are similarly not fully insured against a catastrophic event such as
  dam failures. For example, the failure of the Banqiao Dam caused the death of
  an estimated 30,000 to 200,000 people, and 11 million people lost their homes.
  As private insurers base dam insurance premiums on limited scenarios, major
  disaster insurance in this sector is likewise provided by the state.[187]
  Attacks and sabotage Main articles: Vulnerability of nuclear plants to attack,
  Nuclear terrorism, and Nuclear safety in the United States Terrorists could
  target nuclear power plants in an attempt to release radioactive contamination
  into the community. The United States 9/11 Commission has said that nuclear
  power plants were potential targets originally considered for the September
  11, 2001 attacks. An attack on a reactor's spent fuel pool could also be
  serious, as these pools are less protected than the reactor core. The release
  of radioactivity could lead to thousands of near-term deaths and greater
  numbers of long-term fatalities.[188] In the United States, the NRC carries
  out "Force on Force" (FOF) exercises at all nuclear power plant sites at least
  once every three years.[188] In the United States, plants are surrounded by a
  double row of tall fences which are electronically monitored. The plant
  grounds are patrolled by a sizeable force of armed guards.[189] Insider
  sabotage is also a threat because insiders can observe and work around
  security measures. Successful insider crimes depended on the perpetrators'
  observation and knowledge of security vulnerabilities.[190] A fire caused 5–10
  million dollars worth of damage to New York's Indian Point Energy Center in
  1971.[191] The arsonist turned out to be a plant maintenance worker.[192]
  Nuclear proliferation Further information: Nuclear proliferation See also:
  Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement United States and USSR/Russian
  nuclear weapons stockpiles, 1945–2006. The Megatons to Megawatts Program was
  the main driving force behind the sharp reduction in the quantity of nuclear
  weapons worldwide since the cold war ended.[193][194] Nuclear proliferation is
  the spread of nuclear weapons, fissionable material, and weapons-related
  nuclear technology to states that do not already possess nuclear weapons. Many
  technologies and materials associated with the creation of a nuclear power
  program have a dual-use capability, in that they can also be used to make
  nuclear weapons. For this reason, nuclear power presents proliferation risks.
  Nuclear power program can become a route leading to a nuclear weapon. An
  example of this is the concern over Iran's nuclear program.[195] The
  re-purposing of civilian nuclear industries for military purposes would be a
  breach of the Non-proliferation treaty, to which 190 countries adhere. As of
  April 2012, there are thirty one countries that have civil nuclear power
  plants,[196] of which nine have nuclear weapons. The vast majority of these
  nuclear weapons states have produced weapons before commercial nuclear power
  stations. A fundamental goal for global security is to minimize the nuclear
  proliferation risks associated with the expansion of nuclear power.[195] The
  Global Nuclear Energy Partnership was an international effort to create a
  distribution network in which developing countries in need of energy would
  receive nuclear fuel at a discounted rate, in exchange for that nation
  agreeing to forgo their own indigenous development of a uranium enrichment
  program. The France-based Eurodif/European Gaseous Diffusion Uranium
  Enrichment Consortium is a program that successfully implemented this concept,
  with Spain and other countries without enrichment facilities buying a share of
  the fuel produced at the French-controlled enrichment facility, but without a
  transfer of technology.[197] Iran was an early participant from 1974 and
  remains a shareholder of Eurodif via Sofidif. A 2009 United Nations report
  said that: the revival of interest in nuclear power could result in the
  worldwide dissemination of uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing
  technologies, which present obvious risks of proliferation as these
  technologies can produce fissile materials that are directly usable in nuclear
  weapons.[198] On the other hand, power reactors can also reduce nuclear
  weapons arsenals when military-grade nuclear materials are reprocessed to be
  used as fuel in nuclear power plants. The Megatons to Megawatts Program is
  considered the single most successful non-proliferation program to date.[193]
  Up to 2005, the program had processed $8 billion of high enriched,
  weapons-grade uranium into low enriched uranium suitable as nuclear fuel for
  commercial fission reactors by diluting it with natural uranium. This
  corresponds to the elimination of 10,000 nuclear weapons.[199] For
  approximately two decades, this material generated nearly 10 percent of all
  the electricity consumed in the United States, or about half of all U.S.
  nuclear electricity, with a total of around 7,000 TWh of electricity
  produced.[200] In total it is estimated to have cost $17 billion, a "bargain
  for US ratepayers", with Russia profiting $12 billion from the deal.[200] Much
  needed profit for the Russian nuclear oversight industry, which after the
  collapse of the Soviet economy, had difficulties paying for the maintenance
  and security of the Russian Federations highly enriched uranium and
  warheads.[201] The Megatons to Megawatts Program was hailed as a major success
  by anti-nuclear weapon advocates as it has largely been the driving force
  behind the sharp reduction in the number of nuclear weapons worldwide since
  the cold war ended.[193] However, without an increase in nuclear reactors and
  greater demand for fissile fuel, the cost of dismantling and down blending has
  dissuaded Russia from continuing their disarmament. As of 2013 Russia appears
  to not be interested in extending the program.[202] Environmental impact Main

  by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported that the
  embodied total life-cycle emission intensity of nuclear power has a median
  value of 12 g CO 2eq/kWh, which is the lowest among all commercial baseload
  energy sources.[203][206] This is contrasted with coal and natural gas at 820
  and 490 g CO 2 eq/kWh.[203][206] From the beginning of its commercialization
  in the 1970s, nuclear power has prevented the emission of about 64 billion
  tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that would have otherwise resulted from
  the burning of fossil fuels in thermal power stations.[168] Radiation The
  average dose from natural background radiation is 2.4 millisievert per year
  (mSv/a) globally. It varies between 1 mSv/a and 13 mSv/a, depending mostly on
  the geology of the location. According to the United Nations (UNSCEAR),
  regular nuclear power plant operations, including the nuclear fuel cycle,
  increases this amount by 0.0002 mSv/a of public exposure as a global average.
  The average dose from operating nuclear power plants to the local populations
  around them is less than 0.0001 mSv/a.[207] For comparison, the average dose
  to those living within 50 miles of a coal power plant is over three times this
  dose, at 0.0003 mSv/a.[208] Chernobyl resulted in the most affected
  surrounding populations and male recovery personnel receiving an average
  initial 50 to 100 mSv over a few hours to weeks, while the remaining global
  legacy of the worst nuclear power plant accident in average exposure is 0.002
  mSv/a and is continually dropping at the decaying rate, from the initial high
  of 0.04 mSv per person averaged over the entire populace of the Northern
  Hemisphere in the year of the accident in 1986.[207] Debate on nuclear power
  Main article: Nuclear power debate See also: Nuclear energy policy,
  Pro-nuclear movement, and Anti-nuclear movement Anti-nuclear protest near
  nuclear waste disposal centre at Gorleben in northern Germany The nuclear
  power debate concerns the controversy which has surrounded the deployment and
  use of nuclear fission reactors to generate electricity from nuclear fuel for
  civilian purposes.[28][209][29] Proponents of nuclear energy regard it as a
  sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and increases energy
  security by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources.[210][211][212]
  M. King Hubbert, who popularized the concept of peak oil, saw oil as a
  resource that would run out and considered nuclear energy its
  replacement.[213] Proponents also claim that the present quantity of nuclear
  waste is small and can be reduced through the latest technology of newer
  reactors and that the operational safety record of fission-electricity is
  unparalleled.[17] Other commentators who have questioned the links between the
  anti-nuclear movement and the fossil fuel industry.[214] Kharecha and Hansen
  estimated that "global nuclear power has prevented an average of 1.84 million
  air pollution-related deaths and 64 gigatonnes of CO2-equivalent (GtCO2-eq)
  greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would have resulted from fossil fuel
  burning" and, if continued, it could prevent up to 7 million deaths and 240
  GtCO2-eq emissions by 2050.[168] Opponents believe that nuclear power poses
  many threats to people and the environment[215][216] such as the risk of
  nuclear weapons proliferation and terrorism.[217][218] They also contend that
  reactors are complex machines where many things can and have gone
  wrong.[219][220] In years past, they also argued that when all the
  energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium
  mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is neither a low-carbon nor
  an economical electricity source.[221][222][223] Arguments of economics and
  safety are used by both sides of the debate. Comparison with renewable energy
  See also: Renewable energy debate Slowing global warming requires a transition
  to a low-carbon economy, mainly by burning far less fossil fuel. Limiting
  global warming to 1.5 degrees C is technically possible if no new fossil fuel
  power plants are built from 2019.[224] This has generated considerable
  interest and dispute in determining the best path forward to rapidly replace
  fossil-based fuels in the global energy mix,[225][226] with intense academic
  debate.[227][228] Sometimes the IEA says that countries without nuclear should
  develop it as well as their renewable power.[229] World total primary energy
  supply of 162,494 TWh (or 13,792 Mtoe) by fuels in 2017 (IEA, 2019)[230]:6,8
  Oil (32%) Coal/Peat/Shale (27.1%) Natural Gas (22.2%) Biofuels and waste
  (9.5%) Nuclear (4.9%) Hydro (2.5%) Others (Renewables) (1.8%) A nuclear
  powered aircraft carrier undergoing jet-fuel replenishment at sea operations
  by replenishment oilers. Several studies suggest that it might be
  theoretically possible to cover a majority of world energy generation with new
  renewable sources. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has
  said that if governments were supportive, renewable energy supply could
  account for close to 80% of the world's energy use by 2050.[231] While in
  developed nations the economically feasible geography for new hydropower is
  lacking, with every geographically suitable area largely already
  exploited,[232] proponents of wind and solar energy claim these resources
  alone could eliminate the need for nuclear power.[228][233] Nuclear power is
  comparable to, and in some cases lower, than many renewable energy sources in
  terms of lives lost per unit of electricity delivered.[166][164][234] Nuclear
  reactors also produce a much smaller volume of waste, although much more
  toxic.[235] A nuclear plant also needs to be disassembled and removed and much
  of the disassembled nuclear plant needs to be stored as low-level nuclear
  waste for a few decades.[236] Speed of transition and investment needed
  Analysis in 2015 by professor Barry W. Brook and colleagues found that nuclear
  energy could displace or remove fossil fuels from the electric grid completely
  within 10 years. This finding was based on the historically modest and proven
  rate at which nuclear energy was added in France and Sweden during their
  building programs in the 1980s.[237][238] In a similar analysis, Brook had
  earlier determined that 50% of all global energy, including transportation
  synthetic fuels etc., could be generated within approximately 30 years if the
  global nuclear fission build rate was identical to historical proven
  installation rates calculated in GW per year per unit of global GDP
  (GW/year/$).[239] This is in contrast to the conceptual studies for 100%
  renewable energy systems, which would require an orders of magnitude more
  costly global investment per year, which has no historical precedent.[240]
  These renewable scenarios would also need far greater land devoted to wind,
  wave and solar projects, and the inherent assumption that energy use will
  decrease in the future.[239][240] As Brook notes, the "principal limitations
  on nuclear fission are not technical, economic or fuel-related, but are
  instead linked to complex issues of societal acceptance, fiscal and political
  inertia, and inadequate critical evaluation of the real-world constraints
  facing [the other] low-carbon alternatives."[239] Seasonal energy storage
  requirements Some analysts argue that conventional renewable energy sources,
  wind and solar do not offer the scalability necessary for a large-scale
  decarbonization of the electric grid, mainly due to intermittency-related
  considerations.[241][242][243] A 2018 analysis by MIT argued that, to be much
  more cost-effective as they approach deep decarbonization, electricity systems
  should integrate baseload low carbon resources, such as nuclear, with
  renewables, storage and demand response.[244] In some places which aim to
  phase out fossil fuels in favor of low carbon power, such as the United
  Kingdom, seasonal energy storage is difficult to provide, so having renewables
  supply over 60% of electricity might be expensive. As of 2019 whether
  interconnectors or new nuclear would be more expensive than taking renewables
  over 60% is still being researched and debated.[245] Land use Nuclear power
  stations require approximately one square kilometer of land per typical
  reactor.[246][247] Environmentalists and conservationists have begun to
  question the global renewable energy expansion proposals, as they are opposed
  to the frequently controversial use of once forested land to situate renewable
  energy systems.[248] Seventy five academic conservationists signed a
  letter,[249] suggesting a more effective policy to mitigate climate change
  involving the reforestation of this land proposed for renewable energy
  production, to its prior natural landscape, by means of the native trees that
  previously inhabited it, in tandem with the lower land use footprint of
  nuclear energy, as the path to assure both the commitment to carbon emission
  reductions and to succeed with landscape rewilding programs that are part of
  the global native species protection and re-introduction
  initiatives.[250][251][252] These scientists argue that government commitments
  to increase renewable energy usage while simultaneously making commitments to
  expand areas of biological conservation are two competing land-use outcomes,
  in opposition to one another, that are increasingly coming into conflict. With
  the existing protected areas for conservation at present regarded as
  insufficient to safeguard biodiversity "the conflict for space between energy
  production and habitat will remain one of the key future conservation issues
  to resolve."[250][251] Historic effect on carbon emissions An analysis by
  Benjamin Sovacool of 123 countries over 25 years published in 2020 concluded
  that adoption of renewables tends to be associated with significantly lower
  carbon emissions while larger-scale national nuclear fission energy
  attachments is not. Tensions between these two national energy development
  strategies can reduce their effectiveness in terms of climate change
  mitigation due to factors such as different infrastructure requirements and
  negative association between the scales of national nuclear and renewables
  attachments.[253][254] However, an analysis of the same data by another group
  of scientists came to a different conclusion: "nuclear power and renewable
  energy are both associated with lower per capita CO2 emissions with effects of
  similar magnitude".[255] Societal allocation of resources to nuclear energy
  production-related efforts may compete with resource allocation for research,
  development, construction, expansion and improvement of renewables-related
  technologies and structures such as energy grid systems, energy conservation
  technology and methods, efficient energy use, energy efficiency, energy
  storage, load balancing, sustainable design, novel renewables technologies –
  such as of the hydrogen economy – and smart grids.[256][257][258][259][260]
  Research Advanced fission reactor designs Main article: Generation IV reactor
  Generation IV roadmap from Argonne National Laboratory Current fission
  reactors in operation around the world are second or third generation systems,
  with most of the first-generation systems having been already retired.
  Research into advanced generation IV reactor types was officially started by
  the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) based on eight technology goals,
  including to improve economics, safety, proliferation resistance, natural
  resource utilization and the ability to consume existing nuclear waste in the
  production of electricity. Most of these reactors differ significantly from
  current operating light water reactors, and are expected to be available for
  commercial construction after 2030.[261] Hybrid nuclear fusion-fission Main
  article: Nuclear fusion–fission hybrid Hybrid nuclear power is a proposed
  means of generating power by the use of a combination of nuclear fusion and
  fission processes. The concept dates to the 1950s and was briefly advocated by
  Hans Bethe during the 1970s, but largely remained unexplored until a revival
  of interest in 2009, due to delays in the realization of pure fusion. When a
  sustained nuclear fusion power plant is built, it has the potential to be
  capable of extracting all the fission energy that remains in spent fission
  fuel, reducing the volume of nuclear waste by orders of magnitude, and more
  importantly, eliminating all actinides present in the spent fuel, substances
  which cause security concerns.[262] Nuclear fusion Schematic of the ITER
  tokamak under construction in France. Main articles: Nuclear fusion and Fusion
  power Nuclear fusion reactions have the potential to be safer and generate
  less radioactive waste than fission.[263][264] These reactions appear
  potentially viable, though technically quite difficult and have yet to be
  created on a scale that could be used in a functional power plant. Fusion
  power has been under theoretical and experimental investigation since the
  1950s. Several experimental nuclear fusion reactors and facilities exist. The
  largest and most ambitious international nuclear fusion project currently in
  progress is ITER, a large tokamak under construction in France. ITER is
  planned to pave the way for commercial fusion power by demonstrating
  self-sustained nuclear fusion reactions with positive energy gain.
  Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into
  many delays and budget overruns. The facility is now not expected to begin
  operations until the year 2027–11 years after initially anticipated.[265] A
  follow on commercial nuclear fusion power station, DEMO, has been
  proposed.[266][267] There are also suggestions for a power plant based upon a
  different fusion approach, that of an inertial fusion power plant.
  Fusion-powered electricity generation was initially believed to be readily
  achievable, as fission-electric power had been. However, the extreme
  requirements for continuous reactions and plasma containment led to
  projections being extended by several decades. In 2010, more than 60 years
  after the first attempts, commercial power production was still believed to be
  unlikely before 2050.[266]
