            Compared to other energy sources, nuclear power plants produce 0
            direct greenhouse gases, the main cause of global warming. This
            comes from the fact that nuclear power plants create energy by
            breaking down atoms rather than burning fuels that can release
            unwanted molecules into the air. On that note, by relying more on
            these plants, it is possible to greatly reduce the amount of
            greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere and slow down the rate of global
            warming.

          Nuclear power is extremely effective. 1 kilogram of Uranium-235 can
          generate over 24 million kilowatts of electricity, While 1 kilogram of
          coal only generates about 8 kilowatts of electricity. This means that
          nuclear power plants can easily produce enough energy to meet not just
          the needs of homeowners, but also of factories and other industrial
          and commercial establishments.

          Compared to other types of power plants, nuclear power plants have
          lower operating costs. Uranium, the original energy source of nuclear
          power plants, is relatively less expensive to obtain than other fuel
          sources since it can be easily found in most rocks and even in sea
          water. Nuclear reactors can also last up to 60 years, which means
          there’s no need to build a new power plant every now and then.

            Uranium is one of the least plentiful minerals—making up only two
            parts per million in the earth's crust—but because of its
            radioactivity it is a plentiful supply of energy. One pound of
            uranium has as much energy as three million pounds of coal.
            Radioactive elements gradually decay, losing their radioactivity.
            The time it takes to lose half of its radioactivity is called a
            "half life." U-238, the most common form of uranium, has a half life
            of 4.5 billion years. Uranium is found in a number of geological
            formations, as well as sea water. To be mined as a fuel, however, it
            must be sufficiently concentrated, making up at least one hundred
            parts per million (0.01 percent) of the rock it is in.

          Uranium might be scarce, but thorium, an alternative, is not. Thorium
          is three times more abundant in the Earth's crust than uranium is, and
          is actually more common than other widely known metals, such as the
          likes of mercury and tin. Thorium also appears in higher
          concentrations than uranium, making it easier to extract into a more
          pure material.

          Nuclear power plants may not produce a lot of greenhouse gasses, but
          they do create large amounts of radioactive waste by-products during
          the energy creation process. These waste have high temperatures and
          emit large amounts of radiation so, if they’re improperly disposed of
          and dumped in forests, lakes, and other areas, they can easily
          contaminate the land and bodies of water and destroy plants and
          animals in the vicinity. The worst part of this is that radioactive
          waste can last for thousands of years, which means they can continue
          doing harm even millennia from now. <br />
          The mining process is also similar to coal mining, with both open pit
          and underground mines. It produces similar environmental impacts, with
          the added hazard that uranium mine tailings are radioactive.
          Groundwater can be polluted not only from the heavy metals present in
          mine waste, but also from the traces of radioactive uranium still left
          in the waste.

          Although nuclear waste can't be completely eliminated when using this
          energy generation method, using thorium can greatly decrease the
          amount produced, along with the radioactivity. This is because thorium
          can produce much more energy per ton than uranium can, nearly 100x,
          and the waste it produces are mainly comprised of smaller atoms with
          lower radioactivity.

            The biggest scare involving nuclear power is the fear of a nuclear
            meltdown. This is especially prominent in the media as whenever an
            event occurs, massive desctruction follows suit. A famous example of
            this is the reactor in Pripyat, Russia, the Chernobyl Nuclear Power
            Plant, melting down after engineers attempted to find out what would
            happen in the event of a power outage, but failing to restabilize
            the reactor.

            Throium is much safer than uranium due to it's inability to react
            without addition fissile material, usually plutonium. This means
            that when things do go wrong, the reaction can be easily halted by
            stopping contact between thorium and the fissile material.
