            There are currently 98 power plants throughout 30 states in the US,
            with only 60 of them being open commercially. A large number of
            these power plants are what's called “light water” reactors, meaning
            that they use normal water in the cores of these reactors.<br />
            <p></p>
            A nuclear power plant is actually quite similar to any other
            steam-electric power plant, whether it's powered by coal or natural
            gas. The extreme amount of heat created from the fission of uranium
            is used to heat water up to 520 degrees fahrenheit, or about 270
            degrees celsius. The steam created from the boiling water is then
            pushed out at high pressure to turn a turbine that spins a
            generator, creating electricity.

            Although atoms are tiny, they hold a massive amount of energy
            between the bonds of their nuclei. This energy can be harvested
            through what is called nuclear fission, or the splitting of bonds
            between atoms. By splitting apart chemical bonds holding the atoms
            together chemical energy is released in the form of thermermal
            energy or heat. The heat energy released can then be used to
            generate electricity throughout the power plant.
            <br />
            <p></p>
            Certain isotopes (different forms of an element) of certain elements
            can be more easily fissioned and harvested. For example,
            Uranium-235, or U-235, is the most common isotope used in nuclear
            power plants. Since the uranium atom is quite big in comparison to
            others it is relatively easier to go though the process of Fission.
            <br />
            <p></p>
            During fission, the U-235 atom will absorb loose neutrons causing
            the U-235 to become unstable and split apart into two lighter atoms
            called fission products, energy in the form of heat, as well as two
            to three more neutrons at high velocity. These new neutrons will
            proceed to crash into more atoms causing a chain reaction.

            Thorium is classified as fertile whereas uranium is fissile, meaning
            uranium can undergo fission without the help of a seperate element
            while thorium requires help from a fissile material, usually
            plutonium, to start a sustainable chain reaction. Although this
            sounds like uranium is a better and more efficient option, thorium
            would be much safer because it is unable to meltdown without being
            in contact with the fissile helper material.

            There is also the nuclear waste that is produced through this type
            of energy production that is taken into consideration. Because the
            thorium fuel cycle doesn’t produce transuranic atoms, its waste is
            less toxic in the long run compared to uranium.

          <div class="card-footer">
            Thorium has much more concentration in its ore, up to three times as
            much, meaning that it would take less effort to gain a concentrated
            form of the material. The amount of thorium in the Earth’s crust is
            also nearly three times more than uranium, making it more abundant
            than other commonly known metals, such as silver and tin.
