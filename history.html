          The worst accident in U.S. commercial reactor history occurs at the
          Three Mile Island nuclear power station near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.
          The accident is caused by a loss of coolant from the reactor core due
          to a combination of mechanical malfunction and human error. No one was
          accually injured, But the NRC still imposed a stricter reactor safety
          regulations and more rigid inspection procedures to improve the safety
          of reactor operations.

          DOE initiates the Three Mile Island research and development program
          to develop technology for disassembling and de-fueling the damaged
          reactor. The program will continue for 10 years and make significant
          advances in developing new nuclear safety technology.

          Operator error causes two explosions at the Chernobyl nuclear power
          plant. The reactor has an inadequate containment building, and large
          amounts of radiation escape. More than 30 people had died that day.

            Overview
          </h1>
          On April 26, 1986 in Northern Ukraine, Soviet Russia’s nuclear complex
          reactor 4 exploded, causing what many consider to be the worst
          accident in the history of nuclear power.
          <br />
          Originally, the team of scientists at Chernobyl wanted to test the
          reactor’s ability to recover after an electricity shortage. Their test
          ended up causing a huge steam explosion due to the lack of safety
          procedures and major fundamental flaws in the system.
          <br />
          The explosions caused by the reactors had blown the 1000 ton roof off
          of the reactor, and the amount of radiation was said to be 400 times
          more than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. It had also
          released a dangerous quantity of radioactive substances, including
          iodine-131, cesium-137, plutonium and strontium-90, into the air over
          a period of 2 weeks.
          <h1>
            Human Impacts
          </h1>
          About 30 people died immediately, over 100,000 were killed, and
          numerous more were affected by the radiation as time progressed. After
          4 months, 28 workers had died from the severe radiation poisoning
          while 106 had experienced symptoms of acute radiation sickness.
          Afterwards, about 200,000 cleanup workers had been exposed to doses of
          radiation ranging from 1 - 100 rem, a high amount considering the
          average dose a US citizen is exposed to is about 0.6 rem.
          <br />
          The exclusion zone of 10km assigned after the accident displaced
          49,000 people. This zone was eventually extended to a wider 30km later
          on, displacing 68,000 more people. According to the Ukraine
          government, this zone of evacuation will not be lived on for 24,000
          years to give time for the nuclear waste to become harmless.
          <h1>
            Wildlife Impacts
          </h1>
          Although wildlife was initially harmed greatly by the explosion, and
          is still affected by the radiation, some studies do show that the
          accident has increased wildlife in the area. The complete evacuation
          of humans near the reactor site has allowed plants and animals to
          inhabit the now human-free land and find ways to flourish. Some of
          these animals found include wolves, bison, and beavers.
